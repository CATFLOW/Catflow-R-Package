\title{
Make new discretization for a simulated pipe
}
\description{
Computes a new discretization (xsi- and eta vectors) keeping the grid resolution around 
a horizontal macropore simulated with \code{\link{sim.pipe}}.
}
\usage{
discretize.pipe(sim, steph = 1, stepv = 1, maxdists, dimfaks, 
                top = 1:3, reg = TRUE, plottin = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{sim}{
List with multiplier matrix and vector of positions of horizontal structures 
from macropore simulations with \code{sim.pipe} 
}
  \item{steph}{
Steps for keeping horizontal resolution around begin and end of pipe [no. of columns]
}
  \item{stepv}{
Steps for keeping vertical resolution around pipe [no. of rows]
}
  \item{maxdists}{
Maximum lateral and/or vertical seperation of simulation nodes [no. of columns/rows]
(either a vector for the lateral and vertical, or a single value for both; 
if missing, \code{dimfaks} is used)        
}
  \item{dimfaks}{
Fraction of dimensions to compute missing \code{maxdists}
(either a vector for the lateral and vertical, or a single value for both;
 default: \code{c(0.025,0.05)}, i.e. 2.5\% in lateral and 5.0\% in vertical direction)
}
  \item{top}{
Vector of nodes at upper boundary which should keep a finer discretization
}
  \item{reg}{
Flag for generating a regular grid using \code{maxdists}
}
 \item{plottin}{
Logical if plotting should be done
}
}
\details{
The function \code{discretize.pipe} is used to compute discretization vectors for a CATFLOW 
model domain for which 
pipe-like macropores were simulated on a fine grid with the function \code{sim.pipe}.
It is a wrapper for the internal functions \code{discretize.xsi} and \code{discretize.eta}.

The lateral discretization (xsi-vector) is computed such that the fine resolution is kept at the
endings of the pipe +/-\code{steph},
while the remaining domain is discretized with a 
maximum size of \code{maxdists[1]} columns when \code{reg = TRUE}
(\code{maxdists[1]} is calculated as \code{dimfaks[1]} * \code{ncol(sim)}, if missing) .  

The vertical discretization (eta-vector) is computed such that the fine resolution is kept at the
\code{top} rows and around the pipe +/-\code{stepv}, 
while the remaining domain is discretized with a 
maximum size of \code{maxdists[2]} rows when \code{reg = TRUE}
(\code{maxdists[2]} is calculated as \code{dimfaks[2]} * \code{nrow(sim)}, if missing). 

If desired (\code{plottin = TRUE}), the resulting discretization is plotted schematically.

\value{
A list with two components:
 \item{xsi}{Vector with lateral discretization of model domain}
 \item{eta}{Vector with vertical discretization of model domain}
