\title{
Read soil ID assignment
}
\description{
Reads a file with the soil type identifiers for a CATFLOW simulation. This file is 
automatically produced within the simulation directory during each CATFLOW simulation.
}
\usage{
read.soil.mat(input.file = "boden.dat")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{input.file}{
Name (and path) of the file with the soil type ID's
}
}
\details{
The function \code{read.soil.mat} is designed for reading a soil type assignment
of a CATFLOW simulation. The file "boden.dat" is generated automatically during a
CATFLOW run.
}
\value{
A matrix with soil type identifiers (and same dimensions as the simulation grid of the
CATFLOW run).
