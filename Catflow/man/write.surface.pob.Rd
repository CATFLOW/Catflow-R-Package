\title{
Write surface attribute file for CATFLOW
}
\description{
Writes a file specifying the attributes of the surface nodes for a CATFLOW simulation.
}
\usage{
write.surface.pob(output.file = "surface.pob", 
                  xsi, lu = 33, precid = 1, climid = 1, 
                  windid = rep(1, 4), headr)
}

\arguments{
  \item{output.file}{
Name of file to produce
}
  \item{xsi}{
Lateral discretization of slope profile (vector). 
}
  \item{lu}{
Land-use ID:  either a single number to be assigned to all surface nodes, 
              or a vector of numbers of same length as xsi
}
  \item{climid}{
Climate ID:  either a single number to be assigned to all surface nodes, 
             or a vector of numbers of same length as xsi
}
  \item{precid}{
Precipitation ID: either a single number to be assigned to all surface nodes, 
                  or a vector of numbers of same length as xsi

}
  \item{windid}{
Wind direction ID:  either a vector of numbers representing different wind direction 
                    sectors which are to be assigned to all surface nodes, 
                    or a matrix of numbers with the same number of rows as xsi 
                    and as many columns as there are wind direction sectors (default: 4 sectors)
}
  \item{headr}{
Header line:  defaults to: \code{ paste("3  ", length(windid), "  0\n", 
                    "# Schlag-Id Clima-Id Niederschlag-Id Windrichtungsfaktoren",sep="")}
}
}
\details{
The function 'write.surface.pob' is used for its side-effect: writing a surface attribute file
in CATFLOW-specific format. 
}
\value{
No value is returned. A short message indicates that a file has been produced.
