\title{
Read CATFLOW channel flow output
}
\description{
Reads a channel flow output file from a CATFLOW simulation.
}
\usage{
read.channelflow.out(filename, plotting = T)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{filename}{
  Name (and path) of a channel flow file to read 
}
  \item{plotting}{
Logical if the simulation results should be plotted.
}
}
\details{
CATFLOW produces a channel flow output file when a drainage network is included in the simulation.
This function is prepared to read this file. # File not yet included in example JW 2025-03-15 
}
\value{
A list with the following items:
 \item{orig}{Simulated channel flow in complete and original format(time in seconds, cumulative runoff in cubic meters)}
 \item{converted}{Simulated channel flow with time in days and runoff in liters per second}
