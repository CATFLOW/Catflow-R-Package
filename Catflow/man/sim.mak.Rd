\description{

different random walk parameters can be simulated.

\details{
The function \code{sim.mak} is used to simulate tortuous vertical macropores.
The geometry of the slope profile is given as a vector of horizontal and a matrix of 
vertical coordinates of the simulation grid.

The number of macropores at the surface is determined for each grid cell from a Poisson
distribution, while a minimum separation between macropores is kept. 
The propagation of macropores from the surface is simulated as a Random Walk; 
the individual lengths of the macropores are drawn from a normal distribution.

Macropores within the simulation grid are identified by a factor > 1.  
With \code{kmacro} and \code{ksmean} given, this is a variable factor which relates the
hydraulic capacity of the simulated number of macropores per surface area to the average
hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix. Otherwise, a constant factor of 2 is used.

Two different soil layers can be considered, with different probabilities \code{p.lat}
and different soil matrix conductivities \code{ksmean}, by giving the \code{depth}
for the layer boundary.

The simulation can be combined with results from earlier simulations by given the result matrix
\code{relfak} as input argument.
