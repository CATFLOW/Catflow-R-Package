\details{
The function \code{sim.rectmak} is used to simulate a connected network of 
horizontal and vertical (non-tortuous) macropores. 
The geometry of the slope profile is given as a vector of horizontal and a matrix of 
vertical coordinates of the simulation grid.

A number of vertical macropores is determined for each grid column from a Poisson
distribution, while a minimum horizontal separation between macropores is kept. 
The individual lengths of the vertical macropores are drawn from a normal distribution.
These vertical macropores are then connected by horizontal macropores located at approximately
half the depth of the left vertical macropore.

Macropores within the simulation grid are identified by a factor > 1.  
With \code{kmacro} and \code{ksmean} given, this is a variable factor which relates the
hydraulic capacity of the simulated number of macropores per surface area to the average
hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix. Otherwise, a constant factor of 2 is used.

The simulation can be combined with results from earlier simulations by given the result matrix
\code{relfak} as input argument.
